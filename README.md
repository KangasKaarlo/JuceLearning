# Juce Learning
Two vst plugins that I made to learn the basics of audio developement.
Plugins are made using the JUCE framework

The two subfolders contain two different plugins. One is a simple gain plugin that can adjust inputs volume and the other is a audio compressor with a stripped-down control scheme.
Gain plugin is programmed by manually altering the input data and the compressor uses JUCE's in build dsp modules for the processing.
Color palette for the UI is inspired by old SSL 9000 J consoles.
